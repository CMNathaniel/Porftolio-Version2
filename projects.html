			<h2>Grocery List App</h2>

			Every Thursday I like to make a mealplan for the upcoming week to help maximize healthy eating and saving money by using up ingredients I already have in the house. When I'm done I have a list of ingredients I need to buy from the store. This Grocery List app helps me easily keep track of the items I need to buy and I use it while I'm shopping to keep me focused on just those items.

			<h2>Hero Host Recipe App</h2>
			<p><a href= https://cmnathaniel.github.io/Hero-Host-App/ target="_blank">View Recipe App live</a> |
			<a href= https://github.com/CMNathaniel/Hero-Host-App target="_blank">Recipe App Github Repo</a></p>
			<p>Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, APIs</p>
			<p>I was inspired to build this app after having some Aussie friends over to my house who helped us cook a delicious italian dinner with gin and tonic cocktails. A lot of friends I know have the desire to host more but are reluctant to get in the kitchen and try out dinner or cocktail recipes. This app makes it easy and exciting for users to browse and select recipes for main course meals and cocktails. The user will delight their guests with their kitchen creations and become a Hero Host after using this app.

			<h2>Canadian Citizenship Quiz App</h2>
			<p><a href= https://cmnathaniel.github.io/Canadian-Quiz-App target="_blank">View Quiz App live</a> |
			<a href= https://github.com/CMNathaniel/Canadian-Quiz-App target="_blank">Quiz App Github Repo</a></p>
			<p>Technologies Used: HTML, CSS and Javascript</p>
			<p>In 2019 I became a Canadian citizen and part of that process included studying for and taking a citizenship quiz. I learned so much about about the history, culture and politics of the country during this process and wanted to create a playful quiz that would test other people’s knowledge. Often citizens of countries wouldn’t be able to pass their own citizenship test, so players can see if that’s the case for them or not. </p>
