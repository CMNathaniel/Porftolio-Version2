			<h2>About Me</h2>
				<img src="./images/headshot_cropped.jpg" alt="headshot" id="hero-image">
				<p>I am a Startup Swiss Army Knife, with specialities in full stack development, customer success, human resources and marketing. I also run a career coaching business out of Vancouver, Canada.
				<p>For the last 10 years I’ve worked in technology and have loved getting deep experience in a number of functions within an organization. I am the kind of person that loves to learn and try out new things. That’s why my 2019 move into full stack development has been the perfect intersection of constant learning and technology. I’ve worked at three SaaS companies (Hootsuite, 7Geese and Paycor) and felt like I was ‘on the sidelines’ of the real action happening. As a developer, I now am directly contributing to the product, not merely adjacent to it. As our lives all become more intertwined with technology, I want to be on the front lines creating our future.</p>
				<p>What sets me apart from others is how I work in a team. Anyone can be hired for their technical skills or years of experience on a resume. I pride myself on being extremely easy to work with, across all functions and including with difficult personalities. In moments of stress, which are inevitable, my sense of humour, positive attitude and practical sensibilities motivate those around me to keep going.</p>
				<p>In my free time I love to camp in the Pacific northwest, salsa dance, work on home renovation projects and snuggle my dog Lola.</p>
